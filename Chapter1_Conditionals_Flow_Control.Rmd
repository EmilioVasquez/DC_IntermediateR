## Comparing Vectors

```{r}
# The linkedin and facebook vectors have already been created for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
facebook <- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)

# Popular days
linkedin > 15

# Quiet days
linkedin <= 5

# LinkedIn more popular than Facebook
linkedin > facebook
```

## Comparing Matrices
```{r}

# The social data has been created for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
facebook <- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)
views <- matrix(c(linkedin, facebook), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# When does views equal 13?
views == 13


# When is views less than or equal to 14?
views <= 14

```
## & and |

```{r}
# The linkedin and last variable are already defined for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
last <- tail(linkedin, 1)

# Is last under 5 or above 10?
last < 5 | last >10

# Is last between 15 (exclusive) and 20 (inclusive)?
last >15 & last <=20


# The social data (linkedin, facebook, views) has been created for you

# linkedin exceeds 10 but facebook below 10
linkedin > 10 & facebook <10

linkedin
facebook

# When were one or both visited at least 12 times?
linkedin >= 12 | facebook >=12

# When is views between 11 (exclusive) and 14 (inclusive)?


views >11 & views <= 14


```
```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 7
!(!(x < 4) & !!!(y > 12))
```
